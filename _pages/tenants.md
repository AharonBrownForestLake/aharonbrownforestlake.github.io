Aharon supports the policies outlined in the current Ohio tenant-landlord code, which grants tenants the right to a return of their security deposit, fair housing, 
and notice before landlord entry. Aharon also believes that tenants should not be evicted in instances of financial hardship or extenuating circumstances, 
such as COVID-19.
