Aharon Brown is the proud son of a working mother and grandmother currently residing in Forest Park, Ohio. He is a graduate of Miami University with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science/Criminal Justice and an Associate of Arts in Social Science. He holds a master’s degree from the University of Cincinnati in Community Planning specializing in Community and Economic Development. Seeing the fallout across communities from the 2008 Recession and Foreclosure Crisis Aharon focused his graduate studies on housing affordability. As a graduate student he spent the summer working for a community development corporation working on surveying all vacant and abandoned property in an effort to create more affordable housing throughout Hamilton County. This research was used to inform the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County’s housing affordability initiatives.

Aharon serves as the youngest member of City Council for Forest Park, Ohio, the third largest city in Hamilton County and the second youngest to ever hold the position. Currently, he serves on the city’s planning commission, charter revision committee and is the chair of the city’s Law committee. Aharon volunteers as the Civic Engagement Chair for the Urban League Young Professionals of Greater Southwestern Ohio and as President of the Southwest Chapter of the Ohio Young Black Democrats. His volunteer work centers around collaborating with civic minded leaders who are committed to engaging and empowering the next generation of African American leaders in the political process. Aharon is a founding board member of the New Leaders Council of Southwestern Ohio, a nonprofit dedicated to recruiting young progressives to become involved in their community.
