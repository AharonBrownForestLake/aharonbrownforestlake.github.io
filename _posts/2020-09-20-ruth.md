We have lost a legal giant of our time. Our nation mourns the loss of the incomparable Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was a champion for gender equality and the architect of the legal fight for women’s rights. Originally a Clinton appointee in the early 90s, she would go on to serve on the nation’s highest court for nearly 3 decades and one of it’s most prominent figures.
A towering figure of the virtues of our legal system, Ginsburg’s life is one to be admired and an inspiration to women and girls everywhere. Her popularity knew no bounds as she became a colossal cultural influence in her 80s acquiring the moniker “Notorious RBG.”
Most fittingly, it is her legacy of tireless devotion to our democracy and its ideals that will ultimately change the trajectory of this nation for us all. As we draw closer to the 2020 election, let us follow her shining example. We cannot be drawn towards nihilism or defeatist attitudes, instead let her life be a continual inspiration and commitment to organizing and working for justice.
