The events today regarding the federal investigation into Speaker of the House Larry Householder on charges of bribery come as a tremendous shock to all Ohioans. 
We are facing unprecedented times fighting the pandemic and an ever growing economic crisis and todayâ€™s news only serves as a distraction from our work to provide 
relief to Ohioans. These allegations also act as a betrayal of the public trust and hurts Ohioans faith in our institutions.

We demand that Representative Householder resign immediately and that House Republicans announce new leadership for House speaker. 
It is crucial that our representatives act decisively to get back to work for Ohioans across the state and rebuild trust between public officials 
and the communities we serve.
