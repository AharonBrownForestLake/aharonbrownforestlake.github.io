The recent Supreme Court ruling protecting abortion clinics in Louisiana is a massive victory for reproductive rights. As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, the right to choose is one that shall not be infringed upon and is one that must be protected by the Constitution. Women and pregnant people are under attack every day for what they choose to do with their bodies, and this is just a reminder that some will stop at nothing to restrict that right. The next step is to make Roe v. Wade a federal law. Until then, weâ€™ll always have the risk that the right to choose can be taken away.
