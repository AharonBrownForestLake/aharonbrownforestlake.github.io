I am glad to see that the Winton Woods School Board has voted unanimously to remove the Native American logo. If we claim to be a nation that prides itself on 
diversity, we must acknowledge the harm we cause to the people who are effected by symbols like these. Cultures are not costumes or mascots and these 
sort of displays have always been antiquated and offensive. From here we can move in a new direction.
